# <Prework Study Guide>

## Description

This project was created as a way to edit,access, and read my prework notes and to practice and get myself acquainted with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. All 4 of these elements were used in the creation of this webpage. With the knowledge used to create the page, I can now start the bootcamp running headfirst.

## Installation

## Usage

Each section is labeled and contains notes about a certain topic on how this page was created. The topics include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. Opening the DevTools console using ctrl+shift+I shows us that JavaScript is running in the background. In the console it will list the topics we learned, as well as choose one random topic for us to study. Refreshing the page will choose a topic at random.
